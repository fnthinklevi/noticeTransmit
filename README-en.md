## Quick Start

### Environment Requirements

> **Important**: This project uses **AGP 9.0.1** + **Gradle 9.1.0**, which has minimum version requirements for Flutter / Dart / Android Studio.

| Tool | Minimum Version | Recommended Version | Description |
|------|----------------|--------------------|-------------|
| **Flutter SDK** | 3.44.0 | 3.44.x stable | AGP 9.x support starts from Flutter 3.44 |
| **Dart SDK** | 3.12.0 | 3.12.x | Included with Flutter 3.44, no separate installation needed |
| **Android Gradle Plugin (AGP)** | 9.0.0 | 9.0.1 | Already configured in project |
| **Gradle** | 9.1.0 | 9.1.0 | Already configured (see gradle-wrapper.properties) |
| **Android Studio** | Koala (2024.1.1) | Latest stable | Need IDE version that supports AGP 9.x |
| **JDK** | 21 | 21+ | AGP 9.x requires JDK 21+ |
| **Android SDK** | 21 (minSdk) | 37 (compileSdk) | minSdk 21, target Android 15 |

#### Version Compatibility Notes

## Privacy Notice

### Data Collection Statement

This application values user privacy. The following is a statement about data collection:

| Data Type | Collected | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Notification Content** | ❌ Not uploaded | All notifications are processed and pushed locally only |
| **Contacts/SMS** | ❌ Not uploaded | Only used locally for push, not uploaded to any server |
| **Device ID** | ⚠️ Only for crash statistics | Used by Bugly SDK for device deduplication |
| **Crash Information** | ✅ Collected | Crash stack collected via Bugly for issue fixing |

### Bugly Crash Statistics

- **Purpose**: Only for collecting app crash information to help developers quickly locate and fix issues
- **Collected Content**: Crash stack, app version, system version, device model, CPU architecture
- **Not Collected**: User contacts, SMS content, notification content, location information or any personal privacy data
- **Provider**: Tencent Bugly ([https://bugly.qq.com](https://bugly.qq.com))

### Push Data

All notification pushes are sent through user-configured Webhook URLs. Developers do not store any push content.

## FAQ & Troubleshooting

### Not receiving notifications?
1. Is Notification Access permission enabled
2. Is battery optimization disabled
3. Is foreground service running
4. Is auto-start/background permission enabled for OEM devices
5. Is Webhook URL correct (testable in settings page)
6. Is the notification filtered by app filter / keyword filter

### Hotfix not working?
1. Check if `flutter_contentVersion` is updated
2. Check if files exist in `app_flutter/hotfix/` directory
3. Check logcat for `RELOAD_HOTFIX` broadcast
4. Verify JSON format is correct

### KGP build warnings?
- **Issue**: Flutter 3.44+ introduces Built-in Kotlin, Kotlin Gradle Plugin (KGP) used by some plugins will be deprecated
- **Impact**: Does not affect build and runtime, only a warning
- **Status**: `device_info_plus` and `package_info_plus` updated, `flutter_foreground_task` waiting for author update
